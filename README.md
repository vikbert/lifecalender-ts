LifeCalender is inspired by <strong>Tim Urban's TED talk</strong>. In his humorous talk about the procrastination, he introduced the idea of life calender in his slide.

I create the lifeCalender with both svelte.js and react.js to benchmark the performance difference between virtual DOM and real DOM.

That's one box for every week of a <strong>90-year life</strong>. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long hard look at that calender. We need to stay aware of the instant Gratification monkey. That's a job for all of us.
